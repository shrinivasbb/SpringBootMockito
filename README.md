# SpringBootMockito

Testing Spring boot APIs using Mockito

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/shrinivasb/springbootmockito/branches/master/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/shrinivasb/springbootmockito)

This project uses a library which reduces all the boilerplate code required for building the POJOs for the REST body format using <B>LOMBOK LIBRARY - https://projectlombok.org/ </B>. This helps in replacing the Getters and Setters with a single line which can be declared as just as variables along with Lombok annotations.

Mockito and MockMVC Springboot libraries are used for creating tests in Junit Framework. 

Project is built and Tests are executed using Maven and status is updated from the CI.
